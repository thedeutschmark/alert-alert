## Requirements

### System Dependencies
You need **Python 3.10 or newer** to run or build this project.

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide (For Beginners)

If you are new to installing developer tools, follow these steps exactly:

#### 1. Install Python
1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer.
3. **IMPORTANT:** Check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking "Install Now".
4. Once finished, open Command Prompt as an Administrator (search for `cmd` in Windows).
5. Type `python --version` and hit Enter. You should see Python 3.10 or higher.

#### 2. Install FFmpeg
1. Ensure Command Prompt is open as Administrator (Right-click Command Prompt > Run as Administrator).
2. Type the following command and hit Enter: 
   ```cmd
   winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
   ```
   (Winget is Microsoft's package installer)
3. Wait for it to finish. 

#### 3. Install yt-dlp
1. In the same Command Prompt, type:
   ```cmd
   pip install yt-dlp
   ```
   (pip is Python's package installer)
2. If that works, **restart your computer and then try launching AlertAlert.exe again.**

#### 4. Troubleshooting
If you see errors like `'pip' is not recognized` or `'winget' is not recognized`:
- **For pip:** You likely didn't check "Add Python to PATH" during installation. Reinstall Python and make sure to check that box.
- **For winget:** Ensure you are on a recent version of Windows 10 or 11. You can also download the [App Installer](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1) from the Microsoft Store.

> **Tip:** The app will show you which dependencies are missing and provide individual download links if needed.

## � Troubleshooting

### "FFmpeg not found"
**Solution:** Install FFmpeg using one of these methods:
```bash
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
```
Or download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH.

### "yt-dlp not found"

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

### Video URL not working
